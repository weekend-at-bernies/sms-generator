To run this test you will need to install the following packages:
- libwbxml2-0
- python-wbxml

NOTES:
- python-wbxml last seen in the Ubuntu 10.04 repo (support for it seems to have been dropped from then on)

WARNING:
The XML->WBXML library provided with these packages likes to strip ".com", ".org" and possibly other common domain suffix endings!
